If you built your own SDL, you probably didn't have development headers
for PulseAudio (or ALSA), so it's trying to use /dev/dsp, which doesn't
exist on many modern Linux systems (hence, SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO)
succeeds, but no devices are found when you try to open one). "apt-get
install libasound2-dev libpulse-dev" and rebuild SDL...let the configure
script find the new headers so it includes PulseAudio and ALSA support.

If you didn't build your own SDL, maybe you can force it to use a
different audio path:

SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse ./mytestprogram
or
SDL_AUDIODRIVER=alsa ./mytestprogram


One of those two solutions will (probably) fix your problem.
